 ## Currency Converter Application
 
This project is a Currency Converter web application that allows users to convert one currency to another using real-time exchange rates. The application is built with JavaScript, CSS, and XML for the frontend, and Java for the backend.

## Features

Real-time Currency Conversion: Fetches the latest exchange rates using an API.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design with clean CSS styling.
Customizable: Easily adaptable to support additional currencies and features.
Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile users.
Error Handling: Handles invalid inputs and API errors gracefully.

## Technologies Used

Frontend

JavaScript: Handles DOM manipulation and dynamic interactions.
CSS: Styles the application for a visually appealing user interface.
XML: Manages data structure and exchange rate configurations.

Backend

Java: Implements the server-side logic to process currency conversion requests.
APIs
Integrates with a currency exchange API (e.g., ExchangeRate-API, Open Exchange Rates).
